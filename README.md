Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

This project is a basic implementation of the well-known game of Tic Tac Toe. The game can be played from the console and every move is determined by user input.

Features:

Players input their move coordinates in the console.
The program validates the move (correct format and position).
The program checks for the game ending condition after each valid move.
The game state (current field) is displayed after each move and at the end of the game.

How to run:

Make sure you have Python (3.11.6 or later) installed in your system.
Clone the repository into your local system.
Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
Run tictactoe.py to start the game.

Limitations:

The game is designed for two players playing in turns on the same console, there's no implementation of an AI opponent or network play.
The player symbol (X or O) is set at the start and cannot be changed during the game.
There's no UI, the game is played via console.
The game does not support customization of board size. The board size is fixed at 3x3.
The project currently does not implement an option for saving or loading game state.

Remember, Tic Tac Toe is a game of strategy. Enjoy the game and may the best player win!
